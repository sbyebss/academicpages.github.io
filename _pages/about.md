â€‹I am a second-year PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology. My advisor is [Dr. Yongxin Chen](https://yongxin.ae.gatech.edu/). This is our lab website [FLAIR](https://flair.ae.gatech.edu/). Before this, I got my Bachelor degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).

My research interest lies in the interdisciplinary combination of optimal transport, high dimensional probability and machine learning with applications to provable machine learning and geometries on probability distributions.

Here is my [CV](http://sbyebss.github.io/files/Research_CV.pdf).
